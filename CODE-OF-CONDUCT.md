# Code of Conduct
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Introduction

We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone who contributes to or interacts with our React portfolio project. We value the diversity of our contributors and users and pledge to maintain a harassment-free experience for all, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
We expect all participants to adhere to the guidelines outlined in this Code of Conduct, which are designed to foster a respectful and collaborative community. This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, both online and offline, as well as when representing the project in public spaces.

## Expected Behavior

We encourage the following behaviors from all project participants:

- **Be respectful:** Treat others with kindness and respect. Disagreements are normal, but they should never escalate to personal attacks or insults.
- **Be inclusive:** Welcome and support people of all backgrounds and identities. Be considerate of their perspectives and experiences.
- **Collaborate:** We are a community working towards a common goal. Share knowledge, provide constructive feedback, and work together to achieve our objectives.
- **Be transparent:** Be open about your intentions and actions. Avoid deceptive behavior that can undermine trust in the community.
- **Take responsibility:** If you make a mistake, own up to it and work to correct it. If you witness misconduct, report it to the project maintainers.

## Unacceptable Behavior

We will not tolerate the following behaviors:

- **Harassment:** Any form of harassment, including but not limited to verbal, physical, or visual harassment, is unacceptable. This includes offensive comments, unwelcome advances, and any form of intimidation.
- **Discrimination:** We do not tolerate discrimination based on age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
- **Hate Speech:** Hate speech, discriminatory or derogatory language, or any form of personal attacks are not allowed.
- **Invasion of Privacy:** Do not share personal information about others without their explicit consent.
- **Abuse of Power:** Do not use your position within the community to manipulate or mistreat others.
- **Excessive Disruption:** While constructive criticism is encouraged, excessive disruptions, trolling, or spamming is unacceptable.
- **Engaging in Unlawful Activities:** Do not engage in any unlawful activities while participating in the project.

## Enforcement
